## Overview

A research project for UNLV's Big Data class CS 489 with Dr. Zhan. 
Findings can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/trevjacobson/MachineLearningLeafProject/blob/master/LaTeX/finalproject_Jacobson.pdf)

## Algorithms
I chose to implement a k-means clustering algorithm to classify images of leaves into their respective species for one part of the project.
The second algorithm implemented the Apriori algorithm to extract patterns from a set of anonymized grocery data from a european country.
The k-means clustering algorithm learns from a set of measurements taken on leaf images, the data set cane be found at [UC Irvines Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/leaf).
